## Scanner and parser assignment TODOs 

- [x] Identifiers have to start with a letter or an underscore and then can contain letters, underscore and numbers.
- [x] Identifiers have a max length of 64 characters.
- [x] Names have to follow the *camel case* notation:
  - [x] *lower camel case* have to be used for variables and functions.
  - [x] *upper camel case* have to be used for components and interfaces
- [x] Integer literals implemented as sequence of digits (32 bits):
  - [x] in base 10 *or*.
  - [x] in base 16 prefixed with `0x`.
- [x] Character literals have the form `'c'` where c is a character.
- [x] Special characters are: `\'`,`\b`, `\f`, `\t`, `\\`, `\r`, and `\n`.
- [x] Boolean literals are `true` and `false`.
- [x] Keywords are: `var`, `if`, `return`, `else`, `while`, `int`, `char`, `void`, `bool`, `interface`, `uses`, `provides`, `component`, `connect`, `def`, `for`.
- [x] Operators are: &,  +, -, *, /, %,  =, ==, !=, <, <=, >, >=, &&, ||, !.
- [x] Other symbols: (, ), {, }, [, ], ., <-, :.
- [x] Comments:
  - [x] `//...` single line comments.
  - [x] `/* ... */` multi line comments (no nesting).
- [x] Precedence and associativity rules (lowest to highest):
  - right    =             
  - left     ||
  - left     &&
  - left     ==  != 
  - nonassoc >  <  >=  <=
  - left     +  - 
  - left     *  /  %
  - nonassoc !  &
  - nonassoc [  .   
- [x] Grammar ambiguities:
  - [x] *if-else* shift-reduce conflict -> solved using two new precedence rules (give precedence to shifting else).
  - [x] binary operations shift-reduce conflicts -> solved by using menhir inlining.
